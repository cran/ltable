  \itemize{
  \item{This version is coded in R language exclusively to support across system portability}
  \item{Log-linear and power analyses are enhanced with ability to model risks (rates) and relative risks (standardized ratios). Modelling survival data with interval censoring is also supported.}
  \item{Bug in arguments check-up was eliminated}
  \item{In order to perform power analyses for Hessians with singularity of order above 4  use \emph{ltable} version 2.0.1 available for MacOS machines.
