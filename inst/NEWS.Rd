\section{Changes in version 2.0.4 (2023-08-15)}{
  \itemize{
  \item{This version is coded in R language exclusively to support across system portability}
  \item{Log-linear and power analyses are enhanced with ability to model risks (rates) and relative risks (standardized ratios). Modelling survival data with interval censoring is also supported.}
  \item{Convergency diagnostic is added based on renewal theory}
  \item{In order to perform power analyses for Hessians with singularity of order above 4  use \emph{ltable} version 2.0.1 available for MacOS machines. That implements Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and requires that GSL: GNU Scientific Library has to be installed first. Install GSL: GNU Scientific Library from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl.
